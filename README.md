## EC2 Instances

## SageMaker Studio

... is a local program that manages your SageMaker instances. It sits in front of EC2.

It gives end-users access to a Notebook.

Administrator creates a studio and then shares the domain with developers. Developers won't need to interact with anything other than the notebooks, usually.

In the studio environment, you'll often see 'root'. e.g. in /root/ you can clone git repos and they'll show up in Studio.

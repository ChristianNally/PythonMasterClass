### 8. The Power of the Standard Library

### The Power of the Standard Library
Python prides itself on its "batteries included" philosophy. The standard library offers a wide range of modules and functions for common tasks, so before you reach for an external library, check what Python offers out of the box.

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
// JavaScript might require external libraries for some tasks
console.log("External libraries are often needed for complex tasks.");
```

**Python:**
```
# Using Python's standard library for file and directory manipulation
import os
print(os.listdir('.'))
```

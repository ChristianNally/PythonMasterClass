### 9. Virtual Environments

### Virtual Environments
Python's virtual environments are similar to JavaScript's project-specific `node_modules` but for Python packages. They allow you to manage dependencies on a per-project basis, avoiding version conflicts between projects.

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
// Using npm to install packages locally
console.log("Project-specific dependencies are managed in the node_modules folder.");
```

**Python:**
```python
# Creating a virtual environment in Python
python -m venv myprojectenv
source myprojectenv/bin/activate
(print("Dependencies are managed per project without conflicts."))
```

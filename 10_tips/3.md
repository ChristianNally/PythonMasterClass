### Lambda Functions
Python's lambda functions are akin to JavaScript's arrow functions but with a more limited scope. They're handy for simple operations, especially within functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`.

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let squaredNumbers = numbers.map(number => number * number);
console.log(squaredNumbers);
```

**Python**
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda number: number ** 2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)
```

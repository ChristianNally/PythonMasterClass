### 6. The Pythonic Way: `for` Loops

### The Pythonic Way: `for` Loops
Python's `for` loops are more readable and intuitive. Use them to iterate over items of a sequence directly, without needing to access them via indexes as you often do in JavaScript.

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
for (let i = 0; i < fruits.length; i++) {
    console.log(fruits[i]);
}
```

**Python:**
```python
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```
